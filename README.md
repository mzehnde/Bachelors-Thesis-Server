# How to use the Application

The best way to try the prototype out would be via the following link:

>https://mzrewards-client.herokuapp.com/blockchainReward/partnerHonig

If a valid E-mail address is provided, an E-Mail with a reward is sent to said address. If no reward is sent out, no reward was provided beforehand. So, there must be a provided reward such that the prototype works. However, a permanent reward was uploaded such that the application can be tried out. By using the Software Developer tool in Google Chrome, the hash of the minted NFT can be seen after the E-Mail address was submitted. That way it can also be tracked on Etherscan (Rinkeby Test Net) which ensures that the prototype works and really mints the NFT. But, depending on how many times the application is used, there could be a lack of funds to mint the NFT. However, an appropriate message would be shown in the software developer tool. Additional links and information in the following.

The Frontend for the prototype can be found in the following repo:
